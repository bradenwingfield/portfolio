            “<strong>Everything</strong> around you that you call <strong>life</strong> was made up by people no smarter than you, and you can <strong>change</strong> it, you can <strong>influence</strong> it, you can <strong>build</strong> your own things that other people can use.” — Steve Jobs

            This belief led me to study <strong>computer science</strong>, pursue <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>, and explore how <strong>technology</strong> can shape the world around us. I&apos;m especially drawn to the intersection of <strong>engineering</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, and <strong>business</strong>, because I believe the <strong>future</strong> is shaped by what we build <strong>today</strong>.
